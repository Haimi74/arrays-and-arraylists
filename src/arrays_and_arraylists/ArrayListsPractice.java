//        add 5 elements to it
//        print the entire ArrayList to the terminal
//        print the length of it
//        remove some elements from the ArrayList
//        print the entire ArrayList again
//        change some values in the ArrayList
//        print it again to see your changes

//        Create an ArrayList with 5 elements and give the value in-line (you will need to use Arrays.asList())

//        mess around with a couple methods for ArrayLists. Just type out the ArrayList variable name you made and then put a "." and scroll through the list of methods.
//        read the information it shows you and try to figure out how to use it.
//        create different conditionals using "if-else" statements to test different methods. For example:
//        if (myArray.contains("something")){
//        then do something
//        }
//        print out whatever you need to the terminal to check and see if the methods work the way you think they should.
